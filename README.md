### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned (the hard way) why not to use relative CSS units such as the "vw" or the "vmax" for all measurement units.
Although styling this page gave me a hard time, I learned A LOT from all the mistakes i made. 
As such, I was able to develope my "responsiveness workflow" employing various CSS units and properties etc.
